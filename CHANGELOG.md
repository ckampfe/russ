# Changelog

I welcome contributions to Russ. If you have an idea for something you would like to contribute, open an issue and we can talk about it!
A great way to contribute is to improve the README or documentation!

## Unreleased

- Add the import of OPML files (https://github.com/ckampfe/russ/pull/32)
- Implement `ctrl-d` and `ctrl-u` for page scrolling, thank you @Jaco-Minnaar (https://github.com/ckampfe/russ/pull/31)
- Big internal rearchitecture to make event handling easier to understand and adapt
- Clean up entry insertion code, gets rid of some nasty query string building.
- Bump `ratatui` to `0.26` and fix a few resulting breakages
- Bump `html2text` to `0.12`
- Bump `rusqlite` to `0.31`
- Bump `r2d2_sqlite` to `0.24`
- Bump `webbrowser` to `1`
- Bump lots of transitive dependencies

## 0.5.0

- Russ now creates a feeds database by default. It will be at`$XDG_DATA_HOME/russ/feeds.db` or `$HOME/.local/share/russ/feeds.db` on Linux, and `$HOME/Library/Application Support/russ/feeds.db` on Mac. See the [directories](https://github.com/dirs-dev/directories-rs#projectdirs) docs for more information on how this location is computed. Note that this is a non-breaking change and the `-d` CLI flag will continue to override the default database path, so you can continue to use a different path if you want.
- Reimplement the feed refresh functionality to use regular threads instead of `tokio` and `futures-util`.
- Remove `tokio` and `futures-util`.
- Group operations that mutate the database into meaningful transactions
- Tidy up the [README](README.md)
- Add Github Issue templates, thank you @NickLarsenNZ ([#8](https://github.com/ckampfe/russ/pull/8))
- Fix first-run panics (and improve first-run experience), thank you @NickLarsenNZ for reporting ([#7](https://github.com/ckampfe/russ/issues/7))
- README improvements, thank you @toastal ([#10](https://github.com/ckampfe/russ/pull/10))
- Update dependencies, fixes build on android, thank you @phanirithvij ([#14](https://github.com/ckampfe/russ/pull/14))
- Update clap to version 4
- Remove CircleCI from build (only Github Actions now)
- Fix a clippy warning in test
- CI: use `apt-get` instead of `apt`
- Remove the unmaintained `tui` project, and use `ratatui`, which is a maintained fork
- Fix a few Formatting clippys
- When refreshing a feed, Russ now attempts to use the `If-None-Match` header to check if the server actually has a newer version of the feed, and avoids downloading the feed if it is not newer. This should cut down on quite a bit of network traffic and make Russ a better citizen with regard to hammering sites' feeds.
