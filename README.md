# russ

Russ is a really simple RSS reader built for my own use.
If you happen to like it, that's great!
At this time I cannot guarantee any kind of stability in either the software itself or the data format, or a timeframe for achieving stability. Caveat emptor.

    -d, --database-path <database-path>    feed database path

```

## goals

1. An RSS client in the terminal, not in a webpage
1. Controls how I like them (vim-style navigation)
1. Layout how I like it (columnar layout with higher-level info on the left, content on the right)
1. Fully offline operation - network used only for resyncing feeds
1. All application data in SQLite
1. Fast - all interactions should take place in under 100ms
1. As few configuration/options as possible
1. As little resource usage as possible
1. As few system dependencies as possible - Rust and `sqlite3`

## nongoals

1. Separate client/server processes
1. Browser interaction/support
1. Analysis/metrics - use SQLite itself
1. Sharing/social/posting to Twitter/etc
1. Emacs integration
1. Mobile support

## design

Russ is a [tui](https://crates.io/crates/tui) app that uses [crossterm](https://crates.io/crates/crossterm), so it should (???) work on Windows (I do not use Windows so I cannot verify this, but feel free to open an issue with an experience report)

It stores all application data in a SQLite database file at a location of your choosing. There is no default file. You need to specify this file when you start Russ (see above).
